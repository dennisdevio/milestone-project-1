## UX
My goal was to create an appealing website design and make it as accessible as possible by creating a user-friendly design that works smoothly on all device sizes.

### User Stories

#### First Time User Goals
- As a first time user I want to be able to get a great first impression of your business.
- As a first time user I want to find all information on your services easily.
- As a first time user I want to find all information on your services while on the go.
    
#### Returning User Goals
- As a returning user I want to know current special announcements.
- As a returning user I want to know changes to your menu.
- As a returning user I want to know changes to your opening hours.
- As a returning user I want to be able to easily find information on your social media.

### Structure
The website is built with several sections on one page and it is responsive across all device sizes.
There's the cafe's logo at the top left corner and a navigation menu at the top right, and below that there's an about section describing The Golden Pretzel's services. Further down there is a menu section with a two part menu - with drinks and foods. At the bottom their contact information and opening hours are listed aswell as links to their social media.

### Wireframes
My original idea was to make five wireframes and breakpoints but I felt it didn't make sense so after some consideration I changed it to three. At first I was going to use Balsamiq for the wireframes but I couldn't use it because it turned out it's not available on Linux which I am developing this project on. Therefore I decided to go with [InVision](https://www.invisionapp.com/) instead.

### Design

#### Fonts and Icons
The fonts I chose were Courgette for the headings and Roboto for the paragraph text.
I took the fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and the icons I used for the social media links were taken from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/start).

#### Images
All images were taken from [Unsplash](unsplash.com/). 
I further compressed the images using [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) to decrease load times and keep the performance of the website as smooth as possible.

## Features
On entering the website there's an image carousel on display, showcasing images from the café. 
A hamburger-button menu displayed on smaller screens.
Responsive design between larger and smaller screens.

#### Features Left to Implement
- Adding an iframe map of to location of the café.
- Creating a form for larger orders such as birthday parties and weddings.
Adding another swedish version page to the site with the option to switch between the two.

## Technologies
The technologies utilized to build this website are

### Languages 
- [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) HTML5 was used for structuring the basis of the website. 
- [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS#CSS_3) CSS3 was used for the placement and styling of the HTML5 content. 

They were used in tandem to accomplish the overall look and feel and responsiveness of the website. 

### Frameworks

- [Bootstrap 4.5.3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/) for building a responsive website.

### Libraries 

- [jQuery](https://jquery.com) to simplify DOM manipulation of the Bootstrap Carousel.

### Programs
- I used [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) IDE for all code editing.
