# The Golden Pretzel | Café and Bakery

The aim of this project is to create a webpage for a café called The Golden Pretzel. The purpose of the website is to market
their café and provide information about their services to both new and returning customers.

## User Experience (UX)
The aim was make the user experience as accessible as possible for all clients by creating a website that is easily accessible across all device sizes.

#### Fonts and Icons
The fonts I chose were Courgette for the headings and Roboto for the paragraph text.
I took the fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and the icons I used for the social media links were taken from [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/start)

#### Images
All images were taken from [Unsplash](unsplash.com/). 
I further compressed the images using [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) to decrease load times and keep the performance of the website as smooth as possible.

### Wireframes
My original idea was to make five wireframes and breakpoints but I felt it didn't make sense so after some consideration I changed it to three. At first I was going to use Balsamiq for the wireframes but I couldn't use it because it turned out it's not available on Linux which I am developing this project on. Therefore I decided to go with InVision instead.

The wireframes for this website can be found [here](https://dennischmielewski323696.invisionapp.com/freehand/The-Golden-Pretzel-XozP370FD)

## Features
The website is built with several sections on one page and it is responsive across all device sizes.

### Existing Features
There's the cafe's logo at the top left corner and a navigation menu at the top right, and below that there's an about section describing The Golden Pretzel's services. Further down there is a menu section with a two part menu - with drinks and foods. At the bottom their contact information and opening hours are listed aswell as links to their social media.

### Features Left to Implement

## Technologies
The technologies utilized to build this website are

### Languages 
- [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) HTML5 was used for structuring the basis of the website. 
- [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS#CSS_3) CSS3 was used for the placement and styling of the HTML5 content. 

They were used in tandem to accomplish the overall look and feel and responsiveness of the website.
