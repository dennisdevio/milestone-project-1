## UX
My goal was to create an appealing website design and make it as accessible as possible by creating a user-friendly design that works smoothly on all device sizes.

### User Stories

#### First Time User Goals
- As a first time user I want to be able to get a great first impression of your business.
- As a first time user I want to find all information on your services easily.
- As a first time user I want to find all information on your services while on the go.
    
#### Returning User Goals
- As a returning user I want to know current special announcements.
- As a returning user I want to know changes to your menu.
- As a returning user I want to know changes to your opening hours.
- As a returning user I want to be able to easily find information on your social media.

### Wireframes
My original idea was to make five wireframes and breakpoints but I felt it didn't make sense so after some consideration I changed it to three. At first I was going to use Balsamiq for the wireframes but I couldn't use it because it turned out it's not available on Linux which I am developing this project on. Therefore I decided to go with [InVision](https://www.invisionapp.com/) instead.

### Structure
The website has one page divided into three distinct sections. The home section has a navigation bar with internal links to all different sections aswell as a clickable logo link. Below the navbar I implemented the Bootstrap carousel for showcasing the cafés images with a announcementb bar just below it. The about section further down provides information on the café itself and their passion for baking. The menu is a two-part menu with foods and drinks further divid into sub-sections. The contact information follows the same structure with the opening hours and address divided into two section aswell. At the bottom there are social media links to their social media pages. The menu collapses into a hamburger-button with fold down links on medium-size and small devices.

### Design
The website consists mainly of white color and a shade of yellow color to go with the name of "The Golden Pretzel". My idea was that the yellow color would draw users attention the most important parts of the page, that is why I have made the announcement bar, just below the pictures and the menu with the color yellow background aswell as the navigation bar and footer in the same color. The café's logo is a drawing of a pretzel to go with the theme, I feelt it was a cute and fun detail. The menu links at the top have a underline on hover, and the social media links at the bottom change color from grey to black on hover. The menus have their static underline respectively to draw the users attention to the menu.

#### Fonts and Icons
The fonts I chose were Courgette for the headings and Roboto for the paragraph text.
I took the fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and the icons I used for the social media links were taken from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/start).

#### Images
All images were taken from [Unsplash](unsplash.com/). 
I further compressed the images using [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) to decrease load times and keep the performance of the website as smooth as possible.

## Features
On entering the website there's an image carousel on display, showcasing images from the café. 
A hamburger-button menu displayed on smaller screens.
Responsive design between larger and smaller screens.

#### Features Left to Implement
- Adding an iframe map of to location of the café.
- Creating a form for larger orders such as birthday parties and weddings.
Adding another swedish version page to the site with the option to switch between the two.
